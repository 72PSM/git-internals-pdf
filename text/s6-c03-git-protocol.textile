h2. The Git Protocol

port 9418

Actually, ssh and git are basically identical here, it's just that git is unencrypted, unauthenticated and can only basically run one command, 'git-upload-pack' (Though you can also enable 'receive-pack' or 'upload-archive').

If it wants to invoke git-upload pack, it sends something like '0053upload-pack path/to/repo<NUL>host=git.server.example:9148'. (Ilari)

h3. Fetching

* git fetch-pack

If the server sends incomplete datastream back, you need to complete it before storing. You also need to compute the index file for the pack. (Ilari)

* git upload-pack

h3. Pushing

* git upload-pack
* git receive-pack


* special thanks to Ilari on IRC for walking me through some of this and Shawn Pearce for getting me a copy of unmerged jgit code
