h2. Log - the Commit History

So, now we have all this history in our Git repository.  So what?  What can we do with it?  How can we see this history?

The answer is the very powerful _git log_ command.  The 'log' command will show you your commit history

code. git-log.txt

code. git-log-oneline.txt
