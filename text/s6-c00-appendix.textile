h1. The Appendix

There are some things about Git that took me a while to learn, mostly during my time trying to re-implement a lot of the internals for my pure-ruby version of Git (http://github.com/schacon/git-ruby).  Since most of these are pretty hard to find information on and for programmers like me who haven't touched C since college, I thought it might be useful to try to document some of these concepts in a more understandable way here.
