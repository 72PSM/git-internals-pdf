h2. A Short History of Git

Git started with Linus Torvalds scratching the very serious itch of needing a fast, efficient and massively distributed source code management system for Linux kernel development. 

The kernel team had moved from a patch emailing system to the proprietary BitKeeper SCM in 2002.  That ended in April 2005 when BitMover stopped providing a free version of it's tool to the open source community because they felt some developers had reverse engineered it in violation of the license.

Since Linus had (and still has) a passionate dislike of all existing source code management systems, he decided to write his own.  Thus, in April of 2005, Git was born.  A few months later, in July, maintenance was turned over to Junio Hamano, who has maintained the project ever since.

note. "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git." - Linus

Git started out as a collection of lower level functions used in various combinations by perl scripts.  Recently (since 1.0), more and more of the perl scripts have been re-written in C, increasing portability and speed.
