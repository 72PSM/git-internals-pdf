h2. Advanced Merging

Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software))

Git implements several merging strategies; a non-default can be selected at merge time: [22]

    * resolve: the traditional 3-way merge algorithm.

    * recursive: This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the 3-way merge algorithm. "When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mis-merges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames."[23]

    * octopus: This is the default when merging more than two heads.
