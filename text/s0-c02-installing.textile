h2. Installing Git

todo. clean up this whole section, and actually run through each of these (yes, even windows!)

Before we can start playing with git, we'll have to install it. I'll quickly cover installing git on Linux, Mac and Windows.

You can download git from http://git.or.cz/

http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

h3. Installing on Linux

wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.4.4.tar.bz2
tar jxpvf git-1.5.4.4.tar.bz2
cd git-1.5.4.4
make prefix=/usr all doc info
sudo make prefix=/usr install install-doc install-info

or : apt-get git-core, yum install git-core


h3. Installing on Mac

You are likely going to want to install git without the asciidoc dependency because it is a pain to install.  When you compile from source, you will see

h4. Mac 10.4 - Tiger

There are some requirements you'll have to install before you can compile git.

However, if you want an easier path, you can use the excellent MacPorts software:

http://www.macports.org/

and just run 

# port install git-core


h4. Mac 10.5 - Leopard

All the requirements are installed with the developer CD, so you can just download source and compile pretty easily if the developer tools are installed. 

MacPorts is also an easy option if you have that installed.


h3. Windows
