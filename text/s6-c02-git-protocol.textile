h1. The Git Protocol


port 9418

If it wants to invoke git-upload pack, it sends something like '0053upload-pack path/to/repo<NUL>host=git.server.example:9148'.


Also, if server sends incomplete datastream back, you need to complete it before stroing. You also need to compute the index file for the pack.
