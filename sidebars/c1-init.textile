h3. Setup, Init and Cloning Screencast

I have produced a series of short screencasts demonstrating the topics of several of the chapters in this book, so you can see them in practice on a real command line. You should be able to download these movies with this book from the Peepcode website.

The first in this series is 'Git Setup, Initialization and Cloning' and shows you how to setup your git configuration, how to initialize a new repository and how to clone an existing repository over both the git transport and the HTTP transport.
